    "# Python-First Network and Flow Analysis\n",

    "Perform advanced spatial network analysis, path optimization, and community detection using `OSMnx` and `NetworkX`. This workflow prioritizes local, reproducible computation over proprietary cloud-based black-box solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern urban and environmental analysis requires understanding not just *where* things are, but how they are *connected*. By using Python's native network libraries, you ensure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transparency**: Every step of the routing and centrality algorithm is visible.\n",
    "2. **Intellectual Property**: Custom network discoveries are your own, suitable for scientific publication and patenting.\n",
    "3. **Performance**: Large-scale graph operations are handled efficiently by your local CPU/GPU resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Initialize Network from OpenStreetMap (OSMnx)\n",
    "\n",
    "We bridge the gap between \"Open Data\" (OSM) and \"Open Analysis\" (Python) by downloading data directly into a local graph model."

    "    - **No API Quotas**: Perform millions of route calculations without paying for cloud tokens.\n",
