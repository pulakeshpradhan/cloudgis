    "# Scaling with Dask\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with large-scale remote sensing data, a single machine's memory and computation power may not be enough. Dask allows you to scale your analysis from a single core on your laptop to a cluster of thousands of machines in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Dask for Remote Sensing?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parallelism**: Process multiple image tiles or time steps simultaneously.\n",
    "- **Out-of-core computing**: Work with datasets larger than your RAM by processing data in chunks.\n",
    "- **XArray Integration**: XArray uses Dask as its primary engine for parallelized and lazy computation.\n",
