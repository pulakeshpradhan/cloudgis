    "# Microsoft Planetary Computer\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Microsoft Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/) is a flagship platform for cloud-native remote sensing. It combines a massive STAC-based data catalog with optimized computing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Catalog\n",
    "\n",
    "The Planetary Computer hosts petabytes of open geospatial data, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentinel-2 L2A** (harmonized)\n",
    "- **Landsat 8 & 9** (Collection 2)\n",
    "- **MODIS**\n",
    "- **ERA5** Climate data\n",
    "- **HLS** (Harmonized Landsat Sentinel)\n",
    "\n",
    "All data is indexed via STAC, making it searchable using `pystac-client`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Hub\n",
    "\n",
    "A managed JupyterLab environment pre-configured with the geospatial stack (XArray, Dask, Stackstac, Riomente sensing tools).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. API\n",
    "\n",
    "A RESTful STAC API that allows you to search the catalog from any environment (Colab, local, or the Hub).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To access data from the Planetary Computer, you usually use `pystac_client` and `planetary_computer` for signing URLs."

    "## Why use Planetary Computer?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **STAC First**: Everything is built around the STAC standard.\n",
    "- **Signed URLs**: High-security access to data with \"signing\" that handles authentication automatically for you.\n",
    "- **Pangeo Stack**: Built by and for the Pangeo community, emphasizing XArray and Dask.\n",
    "- **Free for Research**: Most features are free for academic and research use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison with Earth Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Microsoft Planetary Computer | Google Earth Engine |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Data Engine** | XArray / Dask (Python-native) | Earth Engine Object-based (JavaScript/Python API) |\n",
    "| **API Style** | STAC / REST | Proprietary GEE API |\n",
    "| **Philosophy** | Open-source ecosystem | Integrated SaaS platform |\n",
    "| **Compute** | Managed Hub / Dask Gateway | Earth Engine EECU |\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are excellent, but Planetary Computer is often preferred by those who want to use standard Python tools like XArray and Dask directly on the raw data."
